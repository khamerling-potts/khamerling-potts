### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack software engineer skilled in JavaScript, React, and Python with Flask. I have a background in suicide preventionand clinical psychology research that inspired attunement, and cooperation as both a team member and friend.

I strive to foster a culture where each team member can collaboratively engage in goal-setting, so as to enable the free exchange of ideas which is essential to overcoming challenges. Whether in a technical or research capacity, I show open-mindedness, empathy, and tactfulness towards each conversation and relationship. 

In addition to my interpersonal approaches, I am also a huge code lover. I enrolled in Flatiron Schoolâ€™s intensive Software Engineering Bootcamp to pursue a non-traditional trajectory into tech, which has only reaffirmed my passion for software engineering overtime. 

I am seeking SWE apprenticeships, full-time roles, or internships that encourage personal and professional growth. As a woman making a career change into software engineering, I am particularly interested in collaborating with equity-minded organizations that value diversity and innovation.
